These were developed on Mac OS/Big Sur with QEMU installed. And you should
use at your own risk. No warranty. Anything that breaks, you get to
mop up and keep all the pieces.

You can install QEMU with homebrew. e.g. "brew install qemu"

1. i386 and amd64

* Use setup-netbsd.sh to setup your VM.

./setup-netbsd.sh [arch [ver [target dir]]]

By default it will install amd64 version 9.1 in Qemu/NetBSD/
It will attempt to download the ISO from NetBSD.org.

Follow the installer. Once installed, a reboot will attempt to boot
from the CD. If you go to a shell from the installer, issue 
"shutdown -p now", the Qemu will exit along with the program. 

Then:

* Use run-netbsd.sh to run your VM under normal circumstances

./run-netbsd.sh [arch [curses [target dir]]]

By default it will run amd64 from Qemu/NetBSD in
command line curses more.

./run-netbsd.sh i386 blah

will target i386 with normal graphics.

You will need to set dhcpcd=YES in rc.conf. Then networking will work
on boot.

* The sparc64 bit was based on work in this article:

2. arm64

* Use setup-arm64.sh to get the latest bits and pieces including 
working firmware and root filesystem. This will also resize the filesystem
to 10G
* Use run-arm64.sh to run it. Inside the script you can change the
graphics options easily if you prefer not to run headless
