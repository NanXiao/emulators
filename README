These were developed on Mac OS/Big Sur with QEMU installed. And you should
use at your own risk. No warranty. Anything that breaks, you get to
mop up and keep all the pieces.

You can install QEMU with Homebrew. e.g. "brew install qemu".
Or you can install it from the sources. It builds fine on Mac OS/Big Sur
provided you installed Ninja first.

Issues:

1. Make sure you are running Qemu >=5.2 if you want to run Sparc/Sparc64. I cannot get these to boot on 5.1.

2. I am not sure, but I think there is a bug in Qemu 5.2. I've built it from
scratch and used the Homebrew binaries. Large FTP transfers get interrupted.
This happens on all the architectures and both Net and OpenBSD. It could
be a bug on Qemu on Mac.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
The setup script. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

./setup-qemu-vm.sh [OS [arch [ver [... other opts]]]]

This script sets up a VM image file in $HOME/QEmu/$OS, downloads the 
installer ISO and boots the VM into the installer. You can then
customise the installer to get the VM you want.

Once you've finished it is best to power down the VM. I usually do this
by exiting the installer and using "shutdown -p now".

With no options you get NetBSD/amd64.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
The run script. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Then:

./run-qemu-vm.sh [OS [arch [curses [other opts]]]]

will run the VM that you have setup previously.

By default it will run an amd64 VM (provided it has been setup).

------------------------------------------------------------------------
For NetBSD:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
You will need to set dhcpcd=YES in rc.conf. Then networking will work
on boot.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
NetBSD/Macppc
------------------------------------------------------------------------

I can get this to boot, but the network interface doesn't work.

The setup script will get you booted into the installer. You may want
to partition the filesystem to have an HFS partition which later you
can setup to boot from. For this you will need hfstools.

The run script will drop to a Boot prompt. You can boot by typing:
netbsd.macppc -a

The -a will instruct netbsd to ask you for the root filesystem - use wd0a
 
The run script needs the iso to be present on the filesystem.

You could put a kernel and OpenFirmware boot program on an iso image and
use this instead. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------
NetBSD/arm64
------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Use setup-arm64.sh to get the latest bits and pieces including 
working firmware and root filesystem. This will also resize the filesystem
to 10G
* Use run-arm64.sh to run it. Inside the script you can change the
graphics options easily if you prefer not to run headless
