You may be able to find the Solaris Software on archive.org
If you need tools (e.g. compilers) try:

* 9 - Find and download the Solaris 9 Software CD/DVD

* 8 - Find and download the Solaris CD (1 of 2)
* Use use-qemu-vm.sh -i Solaris sparc 8

* 7 - Find and download the Solaris 7 Software D
* Use use-qemu-vm.sh -i Solaris sparc 7

* 2.6 - Find and download the Solaris 2.6 Installation disc
* Use use-qemu-vm.sh -i Solaris sparc 2.6

You use the mini image in the images directory. Copy this to
solaris-disk-sparc.img in the VM directory. This image will resize
up to 8G and has a Sun disk label on it.

If you don't want to use this, follow the instructions below
to use format to setup the label

* When the installer exits, run format and relive the experience of 
a sysadmin from the 90s. Choose 0 for the disc, then 18 - Other
Use these values:

They are sort of correct for an 8G disc:

Enter number of data cylinders: 17700
Enter number of alternate cylinders[2]: 
Enter number of physical cylinders[17702]: 
Enter number of heads: 15
Enter physical number of heads[default]: 
Enter number of data sectors/track: 63
Enter number of physical sectors/track[default]: 
Enter rpm of drive[3600]: 
Enter format time[default]: 
Enter cylinder skew[default]: 
Enter track skew[default]: 
Enter tracks per zone[default]: 
Enter alternate tracks[default]: 
Enter alternate sectors[default]: 
Enter cache control[default]: 
Enter prefetch threshold[default]: 
Enter minimum prefetch[default]: 
Enter maximum prefetch[default]: 
Enter disk type name (remember quotes): Q

Run label twice. The first time you might get an error.


run suninstall. Install Core Solaris.

* Use Manual Reboot when asked

At the very end, do not reboot - use installboot as follows:



cd /usr/platform/sun4m/lib/fs/ufs
# installboot boot* /dev/rdsk/c0t0d0s0

This should not be necessary. But...

* When it has installed, CTRL-A x into the reboot and use
use-qemu-vm.sh without the -i

It booted for me anyway:
