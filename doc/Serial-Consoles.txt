With display curses, things should just work. However some Qemu
installations don't have this built. -nographic can be used but
the console must be a serial one to show up. Here are the various
ways to configuration serial consoles:

OpenBSD/amd64 & i386
--------------------

# You can set the console in boot.conf 
cjep@kernighan% cat /etc/boot.conf
set tty com0

# To log into the console make sure this is in ttys
cjep@kernighan% grep tty00 /etc/ttys
tty00	"/usr/libexec/getty std.9600"	vt220 on secure
