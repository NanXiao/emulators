NetBSD 1.4.3 on qemu
--------------------

I wanted to install this out of nostalgia. I first used NetBSD 1.3
and 1.4.* was on my first work computer. One key thing about 1.4 on
the i386 architecture is that it didn't use the ELF binary format -
it still used the a.out demand pageable executables. I managed to
follow the procedure to update it by source and hand to 1.5 with ELF.
(I think christos at netbsd.org wrote that procedure.)

Anyway, for qemu the network interface has to be chosen specifically 
to work. rtl doesn't work, nor does ne2k_isa. Use ne2k_pci. B
eware also of the Qemu on Mac bug - get the installation sources 
locally is my advice.

If you trust me:

Or if you don't and trust the NetBSD Archive:

1. Grab the installation sets and put them in a dir called 
   cdsources/i386/binary/sets:
 http://archive.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD-archive/NetBSD-1.4.3/i386/binary/sets/

2. Grab the big installation floppy:
 http://archive.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD-archive/NetBSD-1.4.3/i386/installation/floppy/boot-big.fs
 
 and put it in cdsources.

3. On a machine where you have mkisofs
	mkisofs -o NetBSD143.iso -b boot-big.fs -c boot.catalog -l -J -R -allow-leading-dots cdsources

You can also boot directly from boot-big.fs of course and install
over the network (but beware of the Qemu/Mac OS X bug for network)

To create a disc image:
	qemu-img create -f raw netbsd-disk-i386.img 4G

To install off the CD:
	qemu-system-i386 -m 256M -hda netbsd-disk-i386.img -net user -net nic,model=ne2k_pci -cdrom NetBSD143.iso -boot d

or to boot off the floppy:
  qemu-system-i386 -m 256M -fda boot-big.fs -hda netbsd-disk-i386.img -net user -net nic,model=ne2k_pci -boot a

You can -cdrom NetBSD143.iso to the floppy boot too if you like.

For network, use 10.0.2.102/255.255.255.0, gate 10.0.2.2, DNS 10.0.2.3

When you've finished, exit and halt the system. Stop Qemu and then:

To boot regularly:
	qemu-system-i386 -m 256M -hda netbsd-disk-i386.img -net user -net nic,model=ne2k_pci -boot c

You might need to go into the system single user to fix rc.conf. DHCP
client options are available in there. 
Set dhclient=YES and put the network inferface (ne2?) in the flags
variable.

It's 1.4.3 so there's no ssh binaries as standard. Good luck with a.out binaries! :-)
