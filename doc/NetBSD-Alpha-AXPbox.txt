Hi all,

Apologies if this has been covered before, but this afternoon I’ve successfully booted NetBSD/alpha 9.1 on AXPbox (an emulator forked from es40).
https://github.com/lenticularis39/axpbox/wiki

NetBSD is listed as a Guest but lists SCSI as an issue and suggests IDE - I couldn’t get IDE to work and used SCSI. I’ve got further than is documented.
https://github.com/lenticularis39/axpbox/wiki/Guest-support

I used this as a guide:
https://github.com/lenticularis39/axpbox/wiki/OpenVMS-installation-guide

I was able to get through the minimal installation. The config at the end of this e-mail worked for me (es40.cfg). You will need the rom file (see the OpenVMS installation guide).

Booting from the CD looks like this:
P00>>>show device
dka0.0.0.1.0               DKA0                           RZ58  2000
dka100.1.0.1.0             DKA100                        RRD42  4.5d
dva0.0.0.1000.0            DVA0
pka0.7.0.1.0               PKA0                  SCSI Bus ID 7
P00>>>boot dka100

On booting after installation, the emulator has boot flags set to 0 and they need to be set to a for NetBSD to come up multi user (it comes up in single user otherwise).
P00>>>set boot_osflags a
P00>>>boot dka0

Next I need to go and figure out if there are any network options, but it is booting at least with minimal effort.
Chris
